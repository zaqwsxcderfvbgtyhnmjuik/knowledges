introduction:
    The CMake tutorial provides a step-by-step(循序渐进的) guide that covers(覆盖了) common build system issues that CMake helps address. 
    Seeing(了解) how various topics all work together in an example project can be very helpful.
    
    The tutorial source code examples(教程源代码示例) are available in this archive. 
    Each step has its own subdirectory containing code that may be used as a starting point. 
    The tutorial examples are progressive(循序渐进的) so that each step provides the complete solution for the previous step.

CMake是什么：工具序列
    CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software. 
    CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files, 
    and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice. 
    
    CMake is a tool to manage building of source code. 
    Originally, CMake was designed as a generator for various dialects(各种方言) of Makefile, 
    today CMake generates modern buildsystems(现代的构建系统) such as Ninja as well as(和) project files for IDEs such as Visual Studio and Xcode.
    
    CMake is widely used for the C and C++ languages, but it may be used to build source code of other languages too.
